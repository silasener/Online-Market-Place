# Online Marketplace Application

This is a robust and feature-rich online marketplace built using the **Spring Boot** framework. The platform allows users to browse, purchase, and manage their favorite products while also providing powerful tools for administrators to manage products, users, and sellers effectively.

## Key Features and Functionality

### User Features:

- **Secure User Authentication and Authorization**  
  The platform uses **Spring Security** to implement role-based access control (Admin and User), ensuring users have secure access to their accounts. Unauthorized actions are blocked based on user roles.

- **Browse and Search Products**  
  Users can easily browse through products with advanced filtering options such as product categories, price ranges, and more to help them find exactly what they're looking for.

- **Favorites Management**  
  Users can save their favorite products in a personalized list for quick access and easy navigation to preferred items.

- **Block Unwanted Sellers**  
  To enhance user experience and maintain a safe shopping environment, users can block sellers they do not wish to interact with, effectively hiding those sellersâ€™ products from the user's view.

- **View Available Products**  
  Users can view the products they are eligible to purchase, automatically filtering out items from blocked sellers.

### Administrative Features:

- **Comprehensive Product Management**  
  Administrators have full control over the product inventory, allowing them to add, update, or delete products as needed.

- **User Management**  
  Admins can manage user accounts, including the creation, updating, and deletion of user profiles. This helps maintain a secure and well-functioning user base.

- **Seller Management**  
  Admins can manage seller accounts, ensuring only verified and legitimate sellers are part of the marketplace. Seller profiles can be created, updated, and deleted efficiently.

- **Advanced Filtering for Products**  
  Administrators can filter product listings based on multiple criteria (e.g., product categories, price ranges, popularity) to better manage the inventory.

- **Bulk Management for Users and Sellers**  
  Admins can manage large groups of users or sellers by their IDs, streamlining administrative tasks such as bulk deletions or updates.

- **Generate Sample Users for Testing**  
  Administrators can generate sample user accounts for testing or demo purposes, making it easy to test the functionality in different scenarios.
